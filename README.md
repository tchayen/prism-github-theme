# Prism Github theme

I couldn't find any Github-like [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) theme so I made my own.

I am not aware of Prism.js-related conventions so if you have any idea how to make this theme easier to use, distribute etc. – contributions are welcome.

If you know a theme having both of those that already exists – let me know as well, maybe I can move on to that and safely deprecate this one.

If you see some field for improvement that will make styling more accurate to the original – feel free to open a PR.
